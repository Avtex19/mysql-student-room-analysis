This report provides database optimization recommendations for the student room analysis queries.

EXISTING INDEXES (Already Implemented):
✓ PRIMARY KEY on rooms.id and students.id
✓ INDEX on rooms.building for building-based queries
✓ INDEX on rooms.capacity for capacity-based queries
✓ INDEX on students.room_id for JOIN operations
✓ INDEX on students.age for age-based queries
✓ INDEX on students.sex for gender-based queries
✓ COMPOSITE INDEX on students.age, students.sex for combined queries

ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDED INDEXES:
1. INDEX on students.name for name-based searches
2. INDEX on rooms.number for room number searches
3. COMPOSITE INDEX on rooms.building, rooms.number for building+room queries
4. COMPOSITE INDEX on students.room_id, students.age for age-based room queries
5. COMPOSITE INDEX on students.room_id, students.sex for gender-based room queries

QUERY OPTIMIZATION TIPS:
1. Use LIMIT clauses to restrict result sets
2. Use WHERE clauses before JOINs when possible
3. Consider using EXPLAIN to analyze query execution plans
4. Use appropriate data types (INT vs VARCHAR)
5. Consider partitioning for large datasets

PERFORMANCE RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Monitor slow query log for performance bottlenecks
2. Regularly update table statistics with ANALYZE TABLE
3. Consider read replicas for heavy read workloads
4. Use connection pooling for multiple concurrent connections
5. Implement caching for frequently accessed data

SQL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INDEXES:
CREATE INDEX idx_student_name ON students(name);
CREATE INDEX idx_room_number ON rooms(number);
CREATE INDEX idx_building_room ON rooms(building, number);
CREATE INDEX idx_student_room_age ON students(room_id, age);
CREATE INDEX idx_student_room_sex ON students(room_id, sex);

OPTIMIZATION CHECKLIST:
✓ Primary keys defined on all tables
✓ Foreign key constraints properly set
✓ Indexes on frequently queried columns
✓ Composite indexes for multi-column queries
✓ Appropriate data types used
✓ Query execution plans analyzed
✓ Slow query log enabled and monitored
✓ Table statistics updated regularly
